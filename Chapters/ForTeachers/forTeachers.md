## For the teachers

The material of the mooc available at [http://advanced-mooc.pharo.org](http://advanced-mooc.pharo.org) has been used 
for very successful lectures. 

We describe here after the pedagocial objectives, some key insights. 


### Possible pedagocial objectives

The material proposed by the mooc can be used to give lectures on

- Basic object-oriented programming (excluding Law of demeter, Typing, Design pattern for example)
- Test Driven Design 
- Advanced object-oriented design 

### Essence of OO Design from 1/2 to 1 Day Lecture

For a lecture of three hours we usually present the essence of dispatch, key points about inheritance and core extension mechanism.
We use the following material from  [http://advanced-mooc.pharo.org](http://advanced-mooc.pharo.org):

- M1-1 LectureEssence of Dispatch: Taking Pharo Booleans as Example
- M1-2 LectureEssence of Dispatch: Let the receiver decide
- M1-3 LectureInheritance Basics
- M1-4 LectureInheritance and Lookup: Self - Understand lookup once for all
- M1-5 LectureAbout super
- M3-2 LectureMessage Sends are Plans for Reuse
- M3-3 LectureHooks and Template: One of the cornerstones of OOP


### Pharo in 1 Day Lecture

Even if this is not directed supported that the Mooc [http://advanced-mooc.pharo.org](http://advanced-mooc.pharo.org), the Pharo Mooc [http://mooc.pharo.org](http://mooc.pharo.org) can be used and combined to produce a simple introduction to Pharo.

Here is the material that we use.

- W1S01-What is Pharo?
- W1S05-PharoSyntaxInANutshell
- W1S06-Blocks
- W1S07-Basic-Blocks-Loops
- W1S07-BasicBooleansAndCondition
- W1S08-Loops
- W1S10-ClassAndMethodDefinition
- W2S01-Messages
- W2S02-Messages-ForTheJavaProgrammers
- W2S03-Basic-Variables
- W2S03-Messages-Precedence
- W2S04-Messages-Sequence
- W2S07-CharacterStringSymbol
- W2S08-Basic-ArraySetOrderedCollection
- W2S10-Iterators
-  W2S11-Streams

Here are some extra lectures students may want to follow
- W2S05-ParenthesisVsSquareBrackets
- W2S06-Yourself
- W2S09-UnderstandingMistakes
- W3S00-TeapotAsAPretext

We often also present some knowledge about tests:

- M2-1 LectureTest 101: The minimum you should know
- M2-3 LectureTest-Driven Development
- M2-4 LectureXtreme Test Driven Development: Getting a productivity boost

### Basic OOP in 1/2 to 1 day

- W3S01-WhatisAnObject
- W3S02-WhatisAClass
- W3S03-MethodVsMessages
- W3S04-OOParadigm


### Pharo and OOD in 2 Days

Often we start by one day on Pharo and we take another day to show the essence of OOD. 





### Advanced Design Lecture Example

During several years we used and developed around this material the following lecture whose description is available at [https://github.com/UnivLille-Meta/Miage23](https://github.com/UnivLille-Meta/Miage23)

The lectures length was 10 slots of 4 hours covering a mix of lectures and labs. The level of the students was Master 1.
Their level was heterogeneous. 

The objectives of the lectures were: 

- Revisiting basic object-oriented programming 
- Test-Driven Design
- Advanced object-oriented design 
- Reverse engineering
- Test quality with mutation testing
- Soft skills:
-- reporting: how to report activities
-- how to ask help, how to find information
-- how to learn fast a new language

### Setup 

During the first two weeks they had to learn Pharo and report how they are learning, what were their strategies.
We gave no lectures on Pharo. We listed some resources but gave no indication.

- [https://discord.gg/QewZMZa](Pharo discord channel)
- [http://books.pharo.org](Pharo by Example)
- [http://books.pharo.org](Pharo with Style)
- [https://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/OORP.pdf](Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns)



Each week the students had to watch a couple of videos and one or two lectures were stressed during the lectures.
During the first 6 weeks, each week they had to do some exercises following some scripts.
