## Module Exercises

The module is composed of 10 modules and an optional one around Pharo.
There is no direct mapping one to one mapping between the exercises and the modules. 
For example the Module 2 around tests is the second one so that the learners can try to write tests in any of the exercises. In addition when we could all the guided exercises contained tests. 


### Default flow
By default we suggest 
- follow the book order and perform the exercises. Note that the Tamagotchi (Chapter *@cha:tama@*) and Civilization (Chapter *@cha:civilization@*) projects are less guided on purpose and this can give you more space to design solutions.
- then follow some unguided projects as described in Chapter *@cha:unguided@*. Note that each of the unguided projects requires that the extended project has been performed. For the LAN we are giving the possibility to load the code since the exercise is simple. 
-  implement one of the games proposed in Chapter *@cha:games@* or a nice extension of the Microdown project proposed in Chapter *@cha:microdown@*.

%- Chapter *@cha:basicLan@* (A basic LAN application)
%- Chapter *@cha:dsl@* (Crafting a simple embedded DSL with Pharo)
%- Chapter *@cha:stone@* (Stone paper scissors)
%- Chapter *@cha:dsldd@* (Revisiting the Die DSL: a case for double dispatch)
%- Chapter *@cha:robot@* (A little Saturn PathFinder)
%- Chapter *@cha:compass@* (Finding the North with Compass)
%- Chapter *@cha:expressions@* (A little expression interpreter)
%- Chapter *@cha:visitors@* (Understanding visitors)
%- Chapter *@cha:unguided@* (Little unguided projects)
%- Chapter *@cha:tama@* (Tamagotchi Mechanics)
%- Chapter *@cha:civilization@* (Civilization)
%- Chapter *@cha:games@* (Designing little board games)
%- Chapter *@cha:microdown@* (Microdown projects)

### Exercises proposition per Module

#### Module 1.
Chapter *@cha:basicLan@* (A basic LAN application)
You can also follow Chapter *@cha:compass@* (Finding the North with Compass) since it presents some basic ways to use late binding.

#### Module 2. 
Chapter *@cha:dsl@* (Crafting a simple embedded DSL with Pharo).
Another interesting exercise is Chapter *@cha:expressions@* (A little expression interpreter) since it illustrates well object-oriented design and will be extended in Module 6.

#### Module 3.
To exercise Hooks you can work on the Chapter *@cha:unguided@*  section related to the LAN extension. You can also check the extension for the die rolling exercise.

#### Module 4. 
To prepare the exercises of Module 6 we suggest doing Chapter *@cha:expressions@* (A little expression interpreter). 
Here you can for example follow Chapters *@cha:tama@* (Tamagotchi Mechanics) and  *@cha:civilization@* (Civilization).

#### Module 5. 
To exercise the Command pattern do the 
Chapter *@cha:robot@* (A little saturn PathFinder) and you can continue with
Chapter *@cha:compass@* (Finding the North with Compass).
In addition, Chapter *@cha:tama@* is a nice exercise to use the State pattern.

#### Module 6. 
In this module you should do the exercises of Chapter *@cha:stone@* (Stone paper scissors) as well as the one of Chapter *@cha:visitors@* (Understanding visitors).
From then on, you can do the unguided exercises about AST in Chapter *@cha:unguided@* (Little unguided projects) and the Microdown extensions of Chapter *@cha:microdown@* (Microdown projects).
	
#### Module 7, 8, 9, 10. 
From then on you should work on games (see Chapter  *@cha:games@* or Microdown extensions (see Chapter *@cha:microdown@*).
