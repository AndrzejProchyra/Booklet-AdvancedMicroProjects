## Module Exercises

The module is composed of 10 modules and an optional one around Pharo.
There is no direct mapping one to one mapping between the exercises and the modules. 
For example the Module 2 around tests is the second one so that the learners can try to write tests in any of the exercises. In addition when we could all the guided exercises contained tests. 


### Default flow
By default we suggest 
- follow the book order and perform the exercises. 
Note that the Tamagotchi (Chapter *@cha:tama@*) and Civilization (Chapter *@cha:civilization@*) projects are less guided on purpose and this can give you more space to design solutions.
- then follow some unguided projects as described in Chapter *@cha:unguided@*. Note that each of the unguided projects requires that the extended project has been performed. For the LAN we are giving the possibility to load the code since the exercise is simple. 
- Finally we suggest to implement one of the game proposed in Chapter *@cha:games@*

- Chapter *@cha:basicLan@* (A basic LAN application)
- Chapter *@cha:dsl@* (Crafting a simple embedded DSL with Pharo)
- Chapter *@cha:stone@* (Stone paper scissors)
- Chapter *@cha:dsldd@* (Revisiting the Die DSL: a case for double dispatch)
- Chapter *@cha:robot*@ (A little saturn PathFinder)
- Chapter *@cha:compass@* (Finding the North with Compass)
- Chapter *@cha:expressions@* (A little expression interpreter)
- Chapter *@cha:visitors@* (Understanding visitors)
- Chapter *@cha:unguided@* (Little unguided projects)
- Chapter *@cha:tama@* (Tamagotchi Mechanics)
- Chapter *@cha:civilization@* (Civilization)
- Chapter *@cha:games@* (Designing little board games)
