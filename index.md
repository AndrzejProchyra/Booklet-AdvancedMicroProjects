## Introduction

This book accompanies the _'The Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Development with Pharo'_ MOOC (AOOD) that is freely available at [https://advanced-design-mooc.pharo.org](https://advanced-design-mooc.pharo.org).
This Mooc extends the Pharo Mooc [https://mooc.pharo.org](https://mooc.pharo.org).

The current document contains a collection of design exercises at different levels of guidance and difficulties.

- The first part of the book is dedicated to teachers and presents different setups in which this material has been used.
- The second part proposes several little projects to exercise double dispatch, Command and Visitor Design Patterns.
- The third part proposes some unguided extensions to the previous projects as well as some exercises that are also losely described to let space for variations. 
- The fourth part presents some game ideas that you are invited to design and build with Bloc the new graphic layer of Pharo and that can also benefit from the micro framework Myg.

# Unguided Extensions

In this part we propose multiple extensions to the previous mini projects.
It is fun to challenge ourselves to see how we could support the proposed variations.

# Unguided Games

In this part, we propose you design some simple board games using the Bloc graphical framework taking as an example the games of the Myg project.
