## Introduction

This book is a collection of design exercises at different levels of guidance and difficulties.
- The first part starts presenting the basics and can be skipped if you know object-oriented basics.
- The second part proposes several little projects to exercise double dispatch, command and visitor patterns.
- The third part proposes some unguided extensions to the previous projects.
- The fourth part presents some games.


# Starting with basics

The purpose of this mini project is to define a little network simulator. 
 If you understand well basic object-oriented concepts, you can skip this part of the book even if this is fun to code a little simulator and in particular its less guided extensions.

# Unguided Extensions

In this part we propose multiple extensions to the previous mini projects.
It is fun to challenge ourselves to see how we could support the proposed variations.

# Unguided Games

In this part, we propose you design some simple board games using the Bloc graphical framework taking as an example the games of the Myg project.
