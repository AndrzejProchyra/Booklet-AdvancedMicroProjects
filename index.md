## Introduction

This book accompanies the _'The Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Development with Pharo'_ MOOC (AOOD) that is freely available at [https://advanced-design-mooc.pharo.org](https://advanced-design-mooc.pharo.org).

The current document contains a collection of design exercises at different levels of guidance and difficulties.

- The first part is dedicated to teachers and presents different setup in which the material has been used.
- The second part proposes several little projects to exercise double dispatch, command and visitor patterns.
- The third part proposes some unguided extensions to the previous projects.
- The fourth part presents some games.

# Unguided Extensions

In this part we propose multiple extensions to the previous mini projects.
It is fun to challenge ourselves to see how we could support the proposed variations.

# Unguided Games

In this part, we propose you design some simple board games using the Bloc graphical framework taking as an example the games of the Myg project.
