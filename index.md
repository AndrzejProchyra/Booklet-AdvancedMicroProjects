## Introduction

This book is a collection of design exercises at different levels of guidance and difficulties.
- The first part starts presenting the basics and can be skipped if you know object-oriented basics.
- The second part proposes several little projects to exercise double dispatch, command and visitor patterns.
- The third part proposes some unguided extensions to the previous projects.
- The fourth part presents some games.

# Unguided Games

In this part, we propose you design some simple board games using the Bloc graphical framework taking as an example the games of the Myg project.
